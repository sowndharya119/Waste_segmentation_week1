# Waste Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Project Overview
This project aims to promote environmental sustainability by using Artificial Intelligence to automate waste segregation.  
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model is trained to classify waste images into categories such as **plastic, paper, metal, glass, and organic waste**.  
This helps in proper recycling and reduces environmental pollution.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  

## Dataset
**Garbage Classification Dataset (Kaggle):**  
🔗 [Garbage Classification Dataset (v2)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumn2u/garbage-classification-v2)

## Sustainability Impact
This AI-powered model supports **waste segregation automation**, reduces **landfill waste**, and encourages **recycling**, contributing to a **cleaner and greener environment**.
